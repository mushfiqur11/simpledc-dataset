"For example, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection increases the risk of cancer in the lower and middle part of the stomach, while obesity and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) increase the risk of cancer in the upper stomach.","Like, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection gives you more of a chance of getting cancer in the bottom and middle part of the stomach, and being too big and having gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) gives you more of a chance in upper stomach.",Stomach,NCI,Prevention

"In some people, atrophic gastritis leads to increasingly severe changes in the stomach lining and eventually to stomach cancer or gastric MALT lymphoma (see What Is Stomach Cancer? ).
